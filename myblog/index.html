I received my Bachelor Degree in Information Management and Information Systems from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China (2021), and Master of Philosophy from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2023. I am currently pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (2026 expected) under the supervision of Dr Pan Kai. My research interests include stochastic programming, distributionally robust optimization, quadratic programming, and mixed-integer programming.

I am also interesting in a lot of things, such as coding, algorithms, maching learning, traveling, and gaming. All these things make me feel be loved by this world.
