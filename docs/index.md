I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research (2026 expected). I received my Bachelor's degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2021), and M.S. degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (2023).
My research interests include data-driven optimization, distributionally robust optimization, quadratic programming, mixed-integer programming, and their applications. 
My research on these topics has been published in *Operations Research*, *INFORMS Journal on Computing*, and *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*. All these journals are top-tier journals in various fields. 
I was the first-place winner of the [INFORMS Computing Society Student Paper Award][informs] in 2023. 
Additionally, I was awarded the National Scholarship for two consecutive years during my undergraduate studies.

I am also interesting in a lot of things, such as fitness training, traveling, and photography. All these things make me feel be loved by this world.
